        <img src="/img/goulash.jpg">
        <h3>Ingrendients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.4 kg beef chuck roast or blade roast</li>
            <li>700 g yellow onion chopped</li>
            <li>1 L beef stock</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Italian tomato pur√©e (passata)</li>
            <li>sea salt season to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 tsp sweet paprika</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>80 g smoked bacon <br><em>finely cut in small 5 mm (1/4") cubes</em></li>
            <li>1/3 cup Italian parsley <em>finely chopped</em></li>
            <li>10 garlic cloves <em>finely chopped</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Trim excess fat tissue from the meat and cut the meat into ~1" cubes.<br>
                Pay attention to cut against the grain whenever possible. This will<br>
                 shorten the muscle fibers and in turn make pieces easier to chew through.</li>
            <li>Chop the onions. Note: The amount of onions required in the recipe is <br>
                min. 50% of the weight of the meat. More than that is better, but it <br>
                definitely should not be less than 50%.</li>
            <li>Coat the bottom of heavy large pot with olive oil and on top of it <br>
                spread the even layer of chopped onions. Top it up with the layer of <br>
                cubed meat. Put the pot on stove, cover and without stirring cook over <br>
                medium high heat (8 out of 10) for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using a flat bottom wooden spoon stir the mixture. Cover and without <br>
                stirring cook for another 15-25 minutes. If dry add about 1/2 cup of stock <br>
                before covering the pot. Note: You want to finish off this phase with meat <br>
                starting to stick to the pot bottom and fond starts forming. That is what <br>
                will govern if you should cook 15 or 25 minutes. Keep close eye to it <br>
                to prevent excess burning</li>
            <li>Stir the mixture and add about 1 cup of stock. Deglaze the bottom of <br>
                the pot, cover, reduce heat to medium low (2 out of 10) and cook for <br>
                another 130 minutes. Gently stir every 15-20 minutes and incrementally <br>
                keep adding beef stock to maintain proper moisture level. Note: Do not <br>
                flood the goulash by adding the stock all at once! Keep adding stock <br>
                little at the time, as needed. You should maintain meat pieces being <br>
                about 60-70 % submersed in the liquid.</li>
            <li>Season the goulash with salt, pepper, sweet paprika and ground hot pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Stir in Goulash Gevirc, tomato passata and the remainder of the beef stock. If you <br>
                run out of stock and you find the sauce is too thick add some water. Cover the pot, <br>
                wait until it starts simmering and then cook for another 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste the goulash and adjust seasoning as needed. This is a very important step that <br>
                you should not miss! The dish contains fairly large quantity of sweet onions and meat <br>
                and likely will require larger amount of salt from what you would intuitively anticipate.</li>
            <li>Serve warm over a bed of mashed potatoes or polenta.</li>
